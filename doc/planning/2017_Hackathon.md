###Ideas and Resources
* Discover your family history ([Family Search](https://familysearch.org/indexing/)) ([World Record Recap](https://familysearch.org/blog/en/worldsrecordsrecap/))
* PEI Open Data Portal [Link](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/search/site/?f%5B0%5D=type%3Aservice&f%5B1%5D=field_service_topics%3A2237)
* 511 Data [Link](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/view-pei-511-road-conditions)
* GIS Data Portal [Link](http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/)
* Wind Energy [Link](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/view-peis-wind-energy-generation)
* assuming the Province has an official Open Data Portal (e.g. CKAN), explore the API
* NB has an [Open Data Viz Challenge](http://huddle.today/nbsprn-to-host-open-data-visualization-challenge/) that encourages work prior to the event. The event itself is a show-and-tell.  
* Define a specific problem/dataset and concentrate on that for the day. Suggestions:
    * Refine the [PEI Landmarks](http://peidevs.github.io/OpenDataBookClub/landmarks/landmarks.html) project
    * Refine [PDF Thresher](https://github.com/peidevs/OpenDataBookClub/tree/master/tools/PDF_Thresher) so that journalists/others can use it as a standalone binary/website
