This is a collection of various ideas from the group: either for data sets or applications.

### Ideas

* fish kills cause and effect
* energy generation and consumption (green vs import)
* lighthouse maintenance (ownership, relocations) vs. erosion rates. How can you help?
* best beaches (kids, dogs, change rooms, fresh water)
* rate safe bike trips (Land at the airport and cycle to Brackley [?]- route 25 is good to Stanhope [almost])
* How many cyclists consider PEI for a tour?
* Look for actual cycling accidents?
* Where to pick up catch of the day? Lobster trucks, fishing boats? (Tricky to collect)
* How good is the recycling program in your office? Using the Chicago site lingo as in worst landlords ever; let's point fingers! This could be fun!!!
* Green Farms! Where to buy organic produce (for export and local!)
