Like all projects in the 'sandbox' folder, this is an unofficial experiment. 

We are collecting PEI Landmarks: places used in everday conversation. They might still exist... or might not. We're especially interested in landmarks that aren't already on the web (e.g. Google Maps, Open Street Map). This is the people's map!!

See [landmarks.csv](https://github.com/peidevs/OpenDataBookClub/blob/master/data/sandbox/landmarks/landmarks.csv) for working data file. The data will be free and open under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). 

Likely, we will eventually use geoJSON instead of CSV etc. The schema is a straw-man and highly subject to change.

[Here is a basic map](http://bit.ly/1MnpekQ) as a simple visualization.
