# OpenDataBookClub
promoting Open Data on Prince Edward Island

## What is it?

A regular meetup for civic-minded individuals to present / discuss open data. We won't be studying a book: we'll study a *data set*. Check out [this site](http://opendatabook.club/) for more information.

More to follow, but aim is to include government actors (the [blue shirts!](http://ruk.ca/content/man-blue-shirt)), map geeks, librarians, software nerds, statisticans, engaged citizens -- anyone who is interested in Open Data and its potential on PEI. 

## Why PEI?

Inspired by a [lightning talk](http://kittmcg.github.io/ODO-CODS15/#/5) at [CODS15](http://opendatasummit.ca/en/), some members of PEI Developers would like to join [Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto](http://opendatabook.club/#list-of-active-open-data-book-clubs) with a similar venture.

## When?

Early autumn 2015. Follow us at [@peidevs](http://twitter.com/peidevs) for upcoming details!
