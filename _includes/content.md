## Quick News

We're happy to announce that our speaker for September is [Paul Alan](http://twitter.com/peipaulalan), Director of Communications for [Elections PEI](http://electionspei.ca). Paul will speak on [Electoral Reform](http://yourchoicepei.ca) and the upcoming plebiscite. RSVP at our [MeetUp page](http://bit.ly/2cBvhp5) or drop an email to opendatapei@gmail.com

## What is this about?
A regular meetup for civic-minded individuals to present / discuss open data. We won't be studying books: we'll study data sets. Check out [this site](http://opendatabook.club) for more information.

We aim to include engaged citizens, government actors ([the blue shirts!](http://ruk.ca/content/man-blue-shirt)), map geeks, librarians, software nerds, statisticans -- anyone who is interested in [Open Data](http://thirtyforsixty.blogspot.ca/2015/02/what-is-open-data-part-1.html) and its potential on PEI.

## Why PEI?
Inspired by a [lightning talk](http://kittmcg.github.io/ODO-CODS15/#/) at [CODS15](http://opendatasummit.ca/en/), some members of [PEI Developers](http://peidevs.github.io/) would like to join [Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto](http://opendatabook.club/#list-of-active-open-data-book-clubs) with a similar venture. (Based on the [strong turn-out](http://www.meetup.com/PEI-Developers/events/223130904/) for our August warm-up, many others are interested.)

As with PEI Developers, this is a volunteer, non-partisan initiative. We're open and inclusive.

## When

We meet on the 4th week of the month (usually Tuesday). Our next meeting will be on Sept 27, 2016. RSVP at our [MeetUp page](http://bit.ly/2cBvhp5)
