## What is it?
A regular meetup for civic-minded individuals to present / discuss open data. We won't be studying books: we'll study data sets. Check out [this site](http://opendatabook.club) for more information.

We aim to include government actors ([the blue shirts!](http://ruk.ca/content/man-blue-shirt)), map geeks, librarians, software nerds, statisticans, engaged citizens -- anyone who is interested in [Open Data](http://thirtyforsixty.blogspot.ca/2015/02/what-is-open-data-part-1.html) and its potential on PEI.

## Why PEI?
Inspired by a [lightning talk](http://kittmcg.github.io/ODO-CODS15/#/) at [CODS15](http://opendatasummit.ca/en/), some members of [PEI Developers](http://peidevs.github.io/) would like to join [Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto](http://opendatabook.club/#list-of-active-open-data-book-clubs) with a similar venture. (Based on the [strong turn-out](http://www.meetup.com/PEI-Developers/events/223130904/) for our August warm-up, many others are interested.)

## When

Our [first meeting](http://bit.ly/1JOrsr9) is September 22, 2015, featuring:

Peter Rukavina,   
Visiting Scholar (Hacker in Residence),   
Robertson Library, University of Prince Edward Island   

Everyone welcome: the audience is *not* just software developers!  

Just [RSVP via MeetUp](http://bit.ly/1JOrsr9) or send an email to peidevs@gmail.com
