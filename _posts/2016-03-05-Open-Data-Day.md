## Team Presentations

#### Address Liberation 
* Mark Wright, Mike Berger, Chris Stewart
* Leberate the Address Lookup currently available on the pei government website
* Currently a service on a webpage, but needs to be opened for more information
* Built a database from GIS SHP files
* Create a restful API of the data, to get information that is easier for applications to consume
* In DB, the data was easier to write queries to do things like Search for all properties in Stratford
* Still contains GIS data, so you can search for all properties in a given area or range
* Search for police coverage in a given area


#### Bursary
* Michael Easter, Evan Porter, Christian Southgate, Ifo Ikede
* Goal - aggregate infomation about Bursaries and Scholarships
* Lots of public info, but it is scattered
* Data is not easy to get
* Initial idea was automated scraping of PDFs and other data
    * unrealistic, have to write a transformer for every single doc
* Goal became to create the start of a conversation
* Show everyone how good and powerful this can be
* Challenge, data is too spread out. On the pei government site alone, there were a few departments hosting bursary data
    * Department of Workforce and Advanced Learning
    * Advisorie Council for the status of Women 
* Holland College offers similar service, but the information is closed and needs to be scraped

#### Airplane
* Nathan Murnaghan, Nitheen Rao
* Working with Civil Aircraft Register Database
* Comments on current site indicate data is undfriendly.
* Team wanted to clean up data to make it much more usable. 
* Current site is 2 CSV files, hard to link together
* Civil Private Aircrafts.
* Pilots/Owners loooking for their own planes and were having trouble findiing their aircraft
* Team created application which simplified the data and allowed the users to find/search aircrafts
* Data was national
* There was some data which needs cleanup. Showing data in this way it was easier to find bad data. Ex, licence expiry dates of 1900
* First time doing web app for the team. Learned AngularJS for the project

#### Apple TV Street Condition
* Nolan Phillips, Bob Shand, Kelvin Susam, Calista Tan, Ben Sinnamon
* Use Province 511 Data to create an IOS/Apple TV application.
* Trying to Enhance the existing weather reports and traffic conditions
* Challenge, data contained points that were not labeled what spatial data format it was. Caused issues getting the data in lat long. 
* Existing 511 used images instead of spatial data to draw 

#### MapRiddlr
* Sarah Thompson, Patrick Williams, Jullian Keller, Matt White, Nikita Volodin, Celito Felipetto
* Created a game where you had to find a person hidden on the map
* Provided user a hint, and the user had to find the user on the map
* Zoom in on the map until you find person
* Point system, user could ask for hints but would lose points. 1000 point base, lose 200 points for each hint
* A flag on the map would tell you how far you are from the point
* Inspired by Landmarks in PEI. Didn't have time to complete the game and create hints for all locations
    *  Difficulty with some of the points was coming up with the questions and hints
    *  Finding information about major landmarks was easier on a global scale
* Once you find the head, you would click the "head" to start a new game
* Great use of open data. You never know what it will be used for

## Closing Remarks
 * Thank you again to our sponsors: Government of PEI, Startup Zone and Binary Star
