## International Open Access Week at UPEI

For our October MeetUp, we are delighted to partner with UPEI's Robertson Library for an evening, as part of UPEI's participation in [International Open Access Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org/).

The event is a rare Thursday night, hosted at Robertson Library on [the UPEI campus](http://files.upei.ca/map.pdf). This is a terrific opportunity to visit the UPEI campus and interact with researchers on Open Data. Please join us!

There will be two presentations (more details [here](http://bit.ly/2e5QNXF)):

* *The Value of Open Data in Climate Research* by Dr. Adam Fenech
* *Health Data in an Open Data World* by Mary-Ann MacSwain

Please join us **Thursday**, Oct 27, 7 pm at the [StartupZone](http://twitter.com/startupzonepei). RSVP via Facebook or our [MeetUp page](http://bit.ly/2e5QNXF).
