title: PEI Open Data Hackathon, March 5
---

## What is it?
March 5, 2016 is [Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/). There will be many hackathons held across the world, including in Charlottetown, PEI! 

The theme of the hackathon is, naturally, Open Data and we're working to provide some PEI datasets at the event. (That said, using Open Data is not an absolute requirement!)

If you'd like to join us, [register here](http://bit.ly/1RwhOPf). Note that this event is open to both *Builders* and *Attendees*. Builders will work on a team throughout the day; Attendees are welcome to observe the action. You don't have to be a coder: web designers, open data enthusiasts [are welcome](http://bit.ly/1RwhOPf)!

  * Scope your project down to something that can be demoed after 10 hours of heads down hacking. 
  * If the group determines they don't have the right mix of skills or that the project is too big for a hack, they can pivot or join other teams.
