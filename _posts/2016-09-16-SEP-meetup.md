## Electoral Reform

For September, we step away from Open Data *per se*, and consider civic engagement. As you know, PEI takes pride in voter turnout, and so we're excited to feature a presentation on the upcoming plebiscite on [Electoral Reform](http://yourchoicepei.ca) by [Paul Alan](http://twitter.com/peipaulalan), Director of Communications at [Elections PEI](http://electionspei.ca).

This is a terrific opportunity to learn more about the options on the ballot, and the plebiscite itself. 

Please join us Tuesday, Sept 27, 7 pm at the [StartupZone](http://twitter.com/startupzonepei). RSVP via email to opendatapei@gmail.com or our [MeetUp page](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-PEI/events/233915223/).

## Resources

We are non-partisan and neutral on the options. Our goal is to encourage dialogue and amplifly existing resources. To that end, [here is a general introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlDdIKcpF8) on the plebiscite. Videos describing the options are listed below:
